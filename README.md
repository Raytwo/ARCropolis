# ARCropolis

A [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline) plugin for replacing any file in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate by placing mods on your SD card.
Made by Raytwo with help from jam1garner, blujay, Coolsonickirby, and Shadow. Currently maintained by jam1garner.

### Installation and usage
A Wiki is available to help get you started with [setting up ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Overview-(Getting-started)).

### Features
ARCropolis comes built-in with a few features such as:
* [Auto-updater](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Auto-updater)
* [File logger](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/File-logging) (soon!)
* [Workspace manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Workspaces-and-Workspace-Selector)
* [Mod manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Mod-manager)

### Backward compatible with Ultimate Mod Manager
Simply rename your ``sd:/umm/`` directory to ``sd:/ultimate/``, delete your ``data.arc`` and you're good to go!
