# ARCropolis

A [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline) plugin for replacing any file in [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/) by placing mods on your SD card.
Made in equal parts by Raytwo and jam1garner, with lots of help from Shadow as well.

### Installation and usage
A Wiki is available to help get you started with [setting up ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Overview-(Getting-started)).

### Features
ARCropolis comes built-in with a few features such as:
* [Auto-updater](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Auto-updater)
* [File logger](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/File-logging)
* [Workspace manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Workspace-selector)
* [Mod manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Mod-manager)

### Backward compatible with Ultimate Mod Manager
Simply rename your ``sd:/umm/`` directory to ``sd:/ultimate/``, detele your ``data.arc`` and you're good to go!
