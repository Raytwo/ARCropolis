# ARCropolis

A modding framework for loading and managing community-made mods and plugins powered by [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline) for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Made with love by [Raytwo](https://github.com/Raytwo) with help from [jam1garner](https://github.com/jam1garner), [blujay](https://github.com/blu-dev), [Coolsonickirby](https://github.com/Coolsonickirby), [Shadów](https://github.com/shadowninja108) and contributions by many more!

## Installation and usage
A Wiki page is available to help get you started with [setting up ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Overview-(Getting-started)).

## Features
ARCropolis comes built-in with a few features such as:
* [Auto-updater](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Auto-updater)
* [File logger](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/File-logging)
* [Mod manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Mod-manager) (Soon available on boot!)
* ~~[Workspace manager](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Workspaces-and-Workspace-Selector)~~ Returning with version 3.2.0!
* Configuration editor (Soon available on boot!)
* Mod conflict handling
* [An API for plugin developers](https://github.com/Raytwo/arcropolis_api)

### Backward compatible with Ultimate Mod Manager
Simply rename your ``sd:/umm/`` directory to ``sd:/ultimate/``, delete your ``data.arc`` and you're good to go!  
If you need a guide explaining things step-by-step, consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Overview-(Getting-started)).

### Work-in-progress emulator support
While only Ryujinx has some compatibility with ARCropolis for the time being, support for Yuzu is being worked on.  
Please be aware that we are not affiliated in any way with either of these emulators, so we are not responsible for any progress on that front.
If you are interested in using ARCropolis on a emulator, please read [the following](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/issues/195) beforehand.

## Downloads
Head to the [release](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases/latest) page to get the latest build!  
Beta builds are sometimes posted there, but please be aware that you are expected to provide constructive feedback when using them.

### If you run into issues
1. Consider reading the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki/Common-Issues-and-How-To-Fix-Them) section of the [Wiki](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/wiki) to find some pointers on what could have gone wrong.  
2. If you still can't manage to solve the problem, consider opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/discussions/categories/issues) to get some assistance when possible.  
2.1. In the case where you are certain the issue comes from ARCropolis itself, consider opening an issue using one of our various [templates](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/issues/new/choose) available. Use this as a last resort only, as we are flooded with bug reports that are actually user errors.

### An idea for improvements or new features?
Head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/discussions/categories/ideas) tab and suggest your idea(s)! If it sounds doable and useful, it might eventually make it into a future version of ARCropolis!
