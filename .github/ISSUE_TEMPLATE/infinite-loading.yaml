        # DISCLAIMER
        Before posting, make sure to check if the ARCropolis version appears on the title screen. If it does not, you did not install it properly and should not open an issue.  
        
        Please make sure the issue comes from ARCropolis itself by disabling any other plugin you may have and confirming you still get an infinite loading. 
        
        Also, disable your mods until you can pinpoint which one exactly causes the issue before filling the form.
        
        Finally, any issues where the user is using SX OS or ReiNX are not considered and issues with said CFW should not be submitted.
