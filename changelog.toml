<ul>
    <li>ARCropolis is now considered feature complete. Expect mostly bugfixes and QoL improvements from now on.</li>
    <li>If you go online with added slots, you take full responsibility on anything that happens to your Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Online account.</li>
    <li>We do not endorse going online with added slots and recommend not to. Slot spoofing is a work-in-progress and you should NOT trust it blindly, at least for the time being.</li>
